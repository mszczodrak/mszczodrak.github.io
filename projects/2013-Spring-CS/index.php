<h2>Exploration of the Utilization of Compressed Sensing in Image Compression - Spring 2013</h2>

<p>
Over the past decade, a new phenomenon known as compressed sampling has been
developed to improve on the classical Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem. 
Unlike the classical theorem, which states that the sampling frequency must 
be at least twice the maximum frequency present in the signal, compressed 
sampling leverages the sparsity of signals to enable sampling at much lower 
rates. The motivation of this project is using compressed sampling to
compress images at improved levels.
