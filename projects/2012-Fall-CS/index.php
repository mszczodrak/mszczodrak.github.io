<h2>Compressive Sampling on Hadoop - Fall 2012</h2>

<p>
Compressive Sampling is about acquiring and recovering a 
sparse signal in an efficient manner. It involves 
finding the number of measurements that are
necessary to reconstruct the signal. The goal of the
project is to research and explore several compressive 
sampling algorithms and to determine which
algorithm is the best choice to implement in a 
distributed manner.
