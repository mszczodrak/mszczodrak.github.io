<h2>Distributed Computation of Average Temperature within Wireless Sensor Networks - Spring 2014</h2>

<p>
Due to various constraints in power and computational ability of sensors, 
Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have maintained a specific
centralize architecture. In this architecture a sink node, or central hub, 
collects data from all nodes in the network via one hop or through 
multiple hop communication through other nodes. In many scenarios, 
this central or sink nodes communicates with a more powerful source of
computing capability (traditionally a computer, but recently the cloud) 
to process the data and then actuate on the findings. Though stable 
and highly used, the centralized  architecture has significant drawbacks
surrounding latency, security, and energy consumption that have made 
it difficult for WSN to truly react to environments and be capable of
executing 21st century WSN applications. Issues with latency arise 
usually in the communication between WSN and external computing power. 
Failure of data transfer in these bottleneck parts of the architecture
can impact robustness, as well as provide a security weakness. 
Most importantly, the collection of the data and its transfer to an
external source tends to encroach issues of privacy.
